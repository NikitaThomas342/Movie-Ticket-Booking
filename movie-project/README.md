## About The Project

[![MOVIE][MOVIE]](https://localhost:3000)

A movie website with a beautiful UI, using OAuth 2.0 authentication for great security when loggin in and adding items to different lists, this website uses themoviedb API to get the latest movie/tv informations. The user can click on the movie they're interested in, watch the trailer, add to list for later watching.

### Why Use OAuth 2.0?

- It is easy to implement and provides strong authentication. In addition to the two-factor authentication, tokens can be revoked if necessary.
- Uses SSL to ensure that data between the web server and browsers remains private.
